<p>Ha HA! I deleted it locally using only the terminal, then cloned the repository in new files I made to contain it-- 
    This will constitute the changes I will now stage to github!</p>



<p>Okay-- Did not work! I discovered that you apparently can't make changes to a local repo
     that you cloned and you need to pull the entire thing. SOoooooooooooo..
    I deleted the files I had made, then made another to pull the file to. After pulling all of them
I used the shell command to be able to open VS code from the terminal-- 

Almost accidentally saved all of my computer files because I had not specified the file I was about to push from. ops.

Re-opened it, added this change to take note of this saga-- 
 and will now attempt to save it and push to github again- </p>

 <p>Push seemed not to work-- the push went through but for some reason did not show up on github..</p>

 <p>Note-- It did in fact work. it was just not there when I reloaded github. 
    Opened the in browser and have seen that it's up to date. Will check again after this- but IT'S DONE!!
