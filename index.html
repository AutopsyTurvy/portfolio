    <p>Goodbye and hello </p>

    <h1>I did it! : ) </h1>
    <p>Going to try to close the terminal and then open it again so I can make sure I understand how it all works a little more!</p>

    <li>
        <li>Ooops! I went to bed and have slept a looooong time! So today I'll be sure to push through the terminal three times! Once each hour from now!</li>
        <li>Second push of the day! Lets do this!</li>
    </li>

    <p>Oooooh! That last one was great because there were "changes not staged ofr commit", so I got to learn how to commit all files (git commit -a -m "")</p>
    <p>Hi Arthur! I'm not dead! </p>


    <p>Ha HA! I deleted it locally using only the terminal, then cloned the repository in new files I made to contain it-- This will constitute the changes I will now stage to github!</p>
<p>Okay-- Did not work! I discovered that you can't make changes to a local repo
     that you cloned and you need to pull the entire thing. SO..
    I deleted the files I had made, then made another to pull the file to. After pulling all of them
I used the shell command to be able to open VS code from the terminal-- 
i reopened it, added this change to take note of the journey
 and will now attempt to save it and push to github again- </p>

 <p>Push seemed not to work-- the push went through but for some reason did not show up on github..</p>
