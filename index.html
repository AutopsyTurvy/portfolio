<p>Ha HA! I deleted it locally using only the terminal, then cloned the repository in new files I made to contain it-- 
    This will constitute the changes I will now stage to github!</p>



<p>Okay-- Did not work! I discovered that you apparently can't make changes to a local repo
     that you cloned and you need to pull the entire thing. SOoooooooooooo..
    I deleted the files I had made, then made another to pull the file to. After pulling all of them
I used the shell command to be able to open VS code from the terminal-- 

Almost accidentally saved all of my computer files because I had not specified the file I was about to push from. ops.

Re-opened it, added this change to take note of this saga-- 
 and will now attempt to save it and push to github again- </p>

 <p>Push seemed not to work-- the push went through but for some reason did not show up on github..</p>

 <p>Note-- It did in fact work. it was just not there when I reloaded github. 
    Opened the in browser and have seen that it's up to date. Will check again after this- but IT'S DONE!!
 </p>


 <p>Today's adventure is an interesting one, and one that I still haven't figured out-- 
Each time I tried to remove the code files I got the same "Access denied" complaint =
(override r--r--r-- kitty/staff for projects/.git/objects/). 
From there the terminal wouldn't let me change directories or make any commands and I would have to restart the terminal
in order to do anything. I rummaged on the internet to find a solution. I downloaded the files to my computer straight from
github then tried to change permission to who had access to said files. I tried to override the fact that access was denied,
I tried to give permission and followed numerous solutions to try to deal with it. 
In the end I tried to enter the file after some messing about and it said there was no such file path. I assume this means that 
my deleting the file worked SOMEHOW? I'll look into it more after pulling this and making changes to push again.
I managed to pull these files to another code file I made :) It'll be interesting to see if I get the same problem with this file
in the morning! Hope you're having a good weekend!

<li>
    <ul>Cloned</ul>
    <ul>and changes made!</ul>

    <ul>It is a PAIN today! It does not want me to push the changes-- 
        I am continually told that there are changes not staged for commit.
    Trying to work out what's wrong now....</ul>
