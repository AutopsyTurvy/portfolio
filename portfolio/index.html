    <p>Goodbye and hello </p>

    <h1>I did it! : ) </h1>
    <p>Going to try to close the terminal and then open it again so I can make sure I understand how it all works a little more!</p>


    <p>Oooooh! That last one was great because there were "changes not staged ofr commit", so I got to learn how to commit all files (git commit -a -m "")</p>
    <p>Hi Arthur! I'm not dead! </p>


    <p>Ha HA! I deleted it locally using only the terminal, then cloned the repository in new files I made to contain it-- This will constitute the changes I will now stage to github!</p>
